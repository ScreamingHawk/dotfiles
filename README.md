# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the config files that programs use to store preferences. 

This repository is a store of my dotfiles so I can replicate my preferences on a new machine with ease. 

## EditorConfig

My global editorconfig file that I can apply across projects to ensure a somewhat consistent style. 
Particularly with git.. Having whitespace changes can cause disgusting diffs.

Some people don't have this problem. I do.

I've started using [EditorConfig][1] to manage some base whitespace styling and it's been a blessing.

# How to use

Clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/ScreamingHawk/dotfiles`

Navigate into the folder.

`cd dotfiles`

Run the corresponding shell/batch file to copy the files.
